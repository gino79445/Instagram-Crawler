voyaged,Nuku Hiva has a select few white sand beaches where there is reef, rather than the volcanic black sand found elsewhere on the island. Over time, the reef’s dead coral gets washed ashore and ground into the white sand you see here.These beaches are only accessible by trails or boats which means they are almost completely untouched.—📌 #FrenchPolynesia  #nukuhiva #tahiti #tahitibeach—📷 @emmett_sparling and @chelseakauai—#voyaged #travel #adventure #nature,3.5萬,79,2022-03-18T14:44:11.000Z,https://www.instagram.com/p/CbP7ysxtRbN/
